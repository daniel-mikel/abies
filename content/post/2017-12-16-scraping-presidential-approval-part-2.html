<p>The other day I built my first web scraper for a single page. I ended the blogpost pretty satisfied with myself and thought I’d come back to the project at a later date to try to build my first web scraper to take all the presidential approval ratings from the site. I didn’t know how hard it would be at the time, and I was at the end of a long day at work. It might be because the University of California at Santa Barbara’s <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php">The American Presidency Project</a> was uniquely easy to scrape due to it’s url but it took me like 7 minutes. A nice surprise.</p>
<p>If want to read my previous post about scrapping, cleaning, and tidying data from a single page from the <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php">The American Presidency Project</a> check out my previous post <a href="https://abies.netlify.com/2017/12/scraping-presidential-approval/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I used two packages for this project: rvest for scrapping the data from the web, and tidyverse to do most of the manipulation of the scrapped data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;rvest&quot;)
library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
library(&quot;zoo&quot;)
library(&quot;scales&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then I just used my function from last time, but just iterated over the different url’s. I noticed that the two digit numeric chunk in the center of the url corresponed to the number of the presidency. Easy enough. All I needed was a column which I could use to discern different presidencys (I could go by data but this was more efficient).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>all_pres &lt;- as.data.frame(NULL)

for (i in 1:(45-31)){
  i &lt;- i +31
  
  # get url
  url &lt;- paste0(&quot;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/popularity.php?pres=&quot;, i, &quot;&amp;sort=time&amp;direct=DESC&amp;Submit=DISPLAY&quot;)
  
  # scrape data and save as character vector              
  webpage &lt;- read_html(url)
  approval_html &lt;- html_nodes(webpage, &#39;.listdate&#39;)
  approval_data &lt;- html_text(approval_html, trim = TRUE)
  
  # clean character vector of empty data
  approval_data[approval_data==&quot;&quot;] &lt;- NA
  approval_data[1:2] &lt;- NA
  approval_data &lt;- na.omit(approval_data)
  
  # convert to data.fame
  pres_matrix &lt;- matrix(approval_data, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
  pres_df &lt;- as.data.frame(pres_matrix, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  names(pres_df) &lt;- c(&quot;start_date&quot;, &quot;end_date&quot;, &quot;approve&quot;, &quot;disapprove&quot;, &quot;unsure&quot;)
  
  # clean up object classes
  pres_df[] &lt;- lapply(pres_df, type.convert)
  pres_df$start_date &lt;- as.Date(pres_df$start_date, 
                                 format = &quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;)
  pres_df$end_date &lt;- as.Date(pres_df$end_date, 
                               format = &quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;)
  
  # keep information on which president the row of data represents
  pres_df$number &lt;- i
  
  # get data into single dataframe
  all_pres &lt;- rbind(all_pres, pres_df)
}</code></pre>
<p>That was easier than I thought. I didn’t really believe it would work on my first try. Scrapping data from mutliple webpages would probably be pretty challenging on a website with a more opaque url pattern, but I really shouldn’t have psyched myself out of scrapping data from the web.</p>
<p>On another note, I probably didn’t need to clean the data that much before combining it into a single dataframe, but given the small volume of data I was processing this didn’t noticably slow down my code.</p>
<p>Now we just need to get it ready to graph:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_pres &lt;- all_pres %&gt;%
  gather(opinion, percent, -c(number, start_date, end_date)) </code></pre>
<p>Now we can graph whichever POTUS’ approval rating we feel like.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cols &lt;- c(&quot;approve&quot; = &quot;#8BBF9F&quot;, &quot;disapprove&quot; = &quot;#F7A278&quot;, &quot;unsure&quot; = &quot;#A4BFEB&quot;)

tidy_pres %&gt;%
  filter(number == &quot;35&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = end_date, y = percent, col = opinion)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, span = 0.3, se= F) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1)) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = cols) + 
  ggtitle(&quot;Approval Rating: JFK&quot;, subtitle = NULL)</code></pre>

<p>I made a shiny app:</p>
<iframe src="https://daniel-mikel.shinyapps.io/pres_approve_ucsb/?showcase=0" width="768" height="650px">
</iframe>
<p>For some reason running geom_smooth(method = “gam”) was tripping an error when publishing on the shiny server. I ended up just switching to a loess function, but I wasn’t happy that I couldn’t find a direct fix. When I went to publish the this post through blogdown geom_smooth() wasn’t rendering with the rest of the plot.</p>
<p>Here’s the code for the shiny app:</p>

tidy_pres$end_date &lt;- as.Date(tidy_pres$end_date, 
                              format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)

<p>The visual style is pretty similar to the (FiveThirtyEight’s Trump Approval Tracker)[<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo" class="uri">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo</a>], just with less functionallity and data. I should really come up with a more distinct visual style…</p>
<p>I’ll probably set this project down for a little while after this. I’m pretty happy that I’ve gotten some experience with web scrapping, and it’s pretty cool to finally be using my R skills for something politics related.</p>
